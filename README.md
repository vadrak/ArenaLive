# ArenaLive
ArenaLive is a LUA based spectator mode user interface for World of Warcraft arenas. It lets players queue two parties against each other and offers the spectator an interface showing each player's most important information.

## Install
Put all files from the repository into a directory called "ArenaLive" and move that directory into your Word of Warcraft installation's AddOn folder (<WOW-Directory>/Interface/AddOns).

## Usage
After logging in on one of your characters, type "/alive" into your chat frame's edit box and hit enter. An user interface will appear, which lets you queue two players from your Battle.net friend list against each other.

In order for that to work, both players have to be a party leader of a group of at least two people.
